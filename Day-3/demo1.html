    <p style="font-size: 20px;"><b>My <i>childhood</i> was a magical time</b> filled with endless curiosity and
        <small>boundless energy</small>. The world seemed so vast and
        mysterious, and every day felt like a new adventure. I spent countless hours playing in the open fields, chasing
        butterflies, and climbing trees, imagining myself as an explorer on a grand quest. Rainy days meant splashing in
        puddles and building paper boats, while sunny afternoons were perfect for games with friends and laughter that
        echoed through the neighborhood. The warmth of family gatherings, the aroma of my favorite homemade meals, and
        the bedtime stories that sparked my imagination remain etched in my heart. School days brought a mix of learning
        and mischief, from writing on blackboards to sneaking treats during lunch breaks. Each moment of my childhood
        was a mosaic of innocence, wonder, and joy, painting a picture of a simpler yet deeply fulfilling time that I
        hold dear even today.</p>
