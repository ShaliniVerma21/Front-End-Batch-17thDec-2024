          React is one of the most popular, efficient, and powerful open source,
          front-end JavaScript library for building dynamic and interactive user
          interface (UI) in web application. ReactJS is not a framework, it is
          just a library developed by Facebook. It is a simple, feature rich and
          component based UI library. Used to make single page application (Not
          needed to reload everytime). React develops applications by creating
          various reusable and independent codes Known as Components. ReactJS
          can be used to develop small applications as well as big, complex
          applications. React community compliments React library by providing
          large set of ready-made components to develop web application in a
          record time. React community also provides advanced concept like state
          management, routing, etc., on top of the React library. The main
          objective of ReactJS is to develop User Interfaces (UI) that improves
          the speed of the apps. It uses virtual DOM (JavaScript object), which
          improves the performance of the app. The JavaScript virtual DOM is
          faster than the regular DOM. React "reacts" to state changes in your
          components quickly and automatically to re-render the components in
          the HTML DOM by utilizing the virtual DOM. The virtual DOM is an
          in-memory representation of an actual DOM. By doing most of the
          processing inside the virtual DOM rather than directly in the
          browser's DOM, React can act quickly and only add, update, and remove
          components which have changed since the last render cycle occurred.
